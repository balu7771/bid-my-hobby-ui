        <h3>Our Story</h3>
        <p>
          Bid My Hobby started as a passion project by a group of hobbyists who wanted 
          to create a dedicated space for sharing their creations. What began as a small 
          community has grown into a vibrant marketplace connecting creators and collectors 
          worldwide.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe that hobbies are more than just pastimes‚Äîthey're expressions of 
          creativity, skill, and passion. Our platform celebrates the dedication that 
          goes into every handcrafted item and the joy of finding something truly unique.
